# Hibernate ORM Project

A Java project leveraging Hibernate (ORM) to map Java classes to relational database tables. This application demonstrates object-relational mapping, CRUD operations, session management, and configuration using Hibernate.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `src/` — Java source code including entity classes, DAO (Data Access Objects), service layer, etc.  
- `bin/` — (Compiled classes / output, if present)  
- `target/` — (Maven build output)  
- `.settings/`, `.classpath`, `.project` — IDE/project metadata  
- `pom.xml` — Maven configuration file with Hibernate and related dependencies

## 🚀 Features

- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using Hibernate  
- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete for mapped entities  
- Session management (open, close, transaction handling)  
- Configuration via `hibernate.cfg.xml` or via annotations (as relevant)  
- Example queries and relationships (if you’ve included any: one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

- Java  
- Hibernate ORM  
- Maven (build & dependency management)  
- A relational database (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2 etc.)  
- (Optional) Logging framework — e.g., SLF4J / Log4j

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saikrishnavelthapu543/Hibernate-ORM.git
Configure the databas
Set up the database you will use (create schema/tables or let Hibernate auto-generate if configured)
Update database connection settings in hibernate.cfg.xml or via code (URL, username, password, dialect, driver).
Build the project via Maven:
mvn clean install
Run the application (either via your IDE or from command line) to test the CRUD operations.

🔍 Usage Examples
Insert a new entity via DAO
Retrieve entity/entities by ID or list all
Update an existing entity (modify and save)
Delete entity
